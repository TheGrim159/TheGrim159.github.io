The reason how I learned this lesson is that for the last week \n        of the project we had to cut features that were not important to gameplay and focused on trying to polish what we had and bring it all together so that the game felt cohesive instead of disjointed with individual features. One thing we had to cut were \n        related leveling system other than the player leveling up since the leveling system was not core to the gameplay loop of the game and though we were disappointed to get rid of it we had a better game at the end because we cut it.\n    </div>\n    ',"#9BCD50"),new o["a"]("project-8","Legend of Nazera: War","img/projects/LegendOfNazeraMenu.jpg",'\n    <div class="paragraph">\n        <strong>Legend of Nazera: War</strong> Tower defense adventure where you recruit heroes and use them to take down the corruption.\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class="paragraph center">\n        <iframe class="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUOuHogSdZw" title="Nazera Gameplay" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class="paragraph">\n        Main features :\n        <ul>\n        <li>Worked with a team of 13 people</li>\n        <li>I made the save system which saves the player\'s menu settings and has the framework to save levels beaten, dialogues played and heros unlocked but since those features were not finished for the first release they are not in the game.</li>\n        <li>I designed and implemented 3 characters Ambrose the Mage, Cathbad the Druid, and Zorin the Summoner (though Zorin had to be cut due to time since testthe models could not be made in time).
